Custom PDFs

A number of documents are not being generated correctly by LibreOffice. Here, we
provide versions printed from Word with corrected formatting.

The scripts script/upload-staging and -prod will upload the files to both unpublished and published buckets.
A metadata flag of pdfsource=custom-pdfs is set for future use to not overwrite these files.
